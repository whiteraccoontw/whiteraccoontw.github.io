        <h2>Commission Details</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Reference Materials</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>- Please provide a front view reference image of the character (T-pose, A-pose). Providing a three-view
            reference is even better.</p>
          <p>- For complex symbols or patterns, please provide clear image files separately.</p>
          <p>- If the character reference image does not meet the requirements, the estimated price may increase, and
            the number of communication rounds may increase.</p>
          <p>- For furry model production, hair rendering will be simplified appropriately. Realistic fur texture cannot
            be achieved at this time.</p>
          <p>- Currently, primarily accepting male models.</p>
          <p>- Items that cannot be accepted:</p>
          <p>　　Large-area armor, metal models</p>
          <p>　　Realistic, photorealistic style painting</p>
          <p>　　Non-original characters</p>
          <p>- Commissioners should confirm whether the modeler's work style meets their preferences before deciding to
            commission.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3>Similarity to Reference Materials</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>- Visual style and silhouette will be restored as much as possible to the reference image, but complete
            replication is not possible and includes necessary adjustments for 3D rendering.</p>
          <p>- Shadow rendering is mainly to enhance the overall visual feel and will not completely replicate the
            reference image content.</p>
          <p>- Character models may have slight discrepancies due to camera perspective. Please raise questions or
            concerns during the plane model confirmation stage.</p>
          <p>- Model coloring and colors are affected by rendering methods, ambient light settings, etc. The reference
            image will be the main guide during coloring.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3>Model Specifications</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>- 3D Model: The output file is a vrm file suitable for Warudo streaming.</p>
          <p>　　Tested only for Warudo. Although vrm files are compatible with VR Chat,<br>　　their usability on
            the VRC platform is not guaranteed, and related technical support is not provided.</p>
          <p>- Basic bone rigging, application of swaying physics.</p>
          <p>- Basic mouth shapes (A, E, I, O, U).</p>
          <p>- Basic expressions (joy, anger, sorrow, happiness).</p>

          <p><b>Price</b></p>
          <p>- Price range is NT$35,000 to 80,000, evaluated based on requirements and model complexity.</p>
          <p>- Design support: NT$0 to 2,000, for incomplete reference materials or design modifications.</p>
          <p>- Confidentiality agreement: Up to 10% of the full amount, from the model production period until initial
            disclosure or one week after file delivery.</p>
          <p>- AR kit facial capture system: NT$5,000 to 10,000, evaluated based on the model's facial structure.</p>
          <p>- Additional expressions: NT$500 to 1,000 per expression, depending on complexity and effect. Can replace
            some basic expressions.</p>
          <p>- Additional items: NT$800 to 2,500+ per item, for objects not in the reference design (object reference
            image also required).</p>
          <p>- Removable clothing: NT$2,000 to 5,000, adjustments needed to avoid clipping.</p>
          <p><b>Payment Method</b></p>
          <p>- Full payment.</p>
          <p>- 50% deposit, production begins upon confirmation of receipt; 50% balance due upon confirmation of receipt
            before file delivery.</p>
          <p>- <strong>Please confirm you have the full budget before submitting a commission to avoid subsequent
              disputes.</strong></p>
          <p>- Payment methods: Bank transfer and PayPal (overseas).</p>
          <p>- 3D model costs are relatively high. Please carefully assess your financial situation before
            commissioning.</p>
          <p><b>Cancellation/Refund</b></p>
          <p>- If the commissioner cancels the commission for any reason, the paid amount will not be refunded.</p>
          <p>- If the modeler cancels the commission for any reason, all received payments will be refunded.</p>

        <h3>Production Process</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p><b>Modeling and Texturing Process All Done in Blender</b></p>
          <p>1. Plane Model Stage: Fully custom modeling, referencing the outline and muscle/bone texture of the
            reference image; this is a crucial checkpoint.</p>
          <p>2. UV Mapping Stage: UV unwrapping, organizing texture part distribution, reference image color analysis.
          </p>
          <p>3. Rigging and Weight Painting Stage: Applying vrm rig, setting up swaying bones, weight painting.</p>
          <p>4. Shape Key Creation Stage: Adjusting facial expressions, mouth shapes, and other deformations.</p>
          <p>5. Before Blender Export: File organization, baking materials, preliminary testing.</p>
          <p>6. Unity Stage: Importing textures and setting up toon shader, shape key setup, skeleton setup,
            physics-based swaying setup, iterative testing.</p>
          <p>7. Warudo Testing Stage: Facial capture testing, expressions, actual swaying effect testing.</p>
          <p><b>Modifications and Communication</b></p>
          <p>- Each stage involves changes that are difficult to revert to varying degrees, so please pay close
            attention during checkpoints.</p>
          <p>- Production time depends on the model's complexity, estimated at 6 to 10 weeks, with weekly progress
            updates.</p>
          <p>- Minor revisions are accepted within 14 days after model delivery. After the deadline or once revisions
            are complete, the commission will be officially closed.</p>
          <p>- The completed model will be included in the modeler's portfolio.</p>
